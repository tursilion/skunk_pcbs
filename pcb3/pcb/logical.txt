Logical model:

	USB Controller
		4KB FIFO connects to:
			OHCI _or_
			Mass Storage Controller by way of AES crypto engine
		4KB registers store:
			Mass Storage Block List (for streaming/seeking) 
			HCM (Host Controller Machine) Instructions
			EEPROM and Memory Track Buffers (used by MSC)
			COM port buffer
		Link controller connects to:
			Mass Storage Controller
			COM port buffer
			Interrupt/Reset logic

	Bus Controller
		Jaguar bus connects to:
			Cartridge Memory
			Bus config register (memory map, reset, SPI rate, etc)
			4KB FIFO
			4KB registers
		Jaguar audio out/CD in connects to FIFO			
		Cartridge EEPROM connects to EEPROM/Memory Track buffer
		UART connects to COM port buffer

	Cartridge Memory
