These are is the PCB layouts for the Skunkboard. PCB3 seems to contain multiple revisions as well, but I'm not well versed in the contents of these folders, so you get them all! I can't even tell you what software they belong to. (Maybe FreePCB?)

I have the Rev4 layout which was done for SillyVenture (not by me), but I don't know if I'm allowed to add it.

The Skunkboard requires LibUSB 0.1 to be available. For Windows, the .lib and header file are provided. 
For Linux or OSX, you must get these files yourself and set up LibUSB on your system correctly.

For getting the libUSB drivers on modern Windows operating systems, this tool has been useful:

JCP and all original SKUNKBOARD properties (source, binary, design, etc) are released to the PUBLIC DOMAIN. No support is available, no warranty is possible, and you can do whatever you like with it, except claim ownership. :)

This is an upgraded version by cubanismo that includes a couple of EEPROMs and other updates.
