USB B can only go 3mm past the end of the board
USB A can go 9mm past the end of the board

	This ensures devices are nice and flush
	All laptops have extra plastic above the port

Raised plastic lets us have minimal bracing 'behind' the port
	This lets us have a little more of a shelf behind

I have to get SolidWorks and get busy(er)...
