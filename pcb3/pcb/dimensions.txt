Courtyard madness:
	The outlines in my silk screen tend to match courtyard or assembly drawings
	C0603s in particular have fatter lines than the underlying courtyard

Mounting holes:
	We have 100 mil mounting holes, so a #3 self-tapping screw (.1" diameter) is appropriate
		#2 is another common size (.086" diameter)

Aluminum cap size:
	EMVA100ADA151MF55G is an 'F55', which makes it:
		5.2-5.7 mm high
		6.6mm x 6.6mm (A+B)
		7.2 mm from outer pins (C)

		The positive pad is marked with inward edges on the footprint

	There is no guide on pad size...
		The CY's are 1.5 mm wide -- which makes sense with pins up to 0.8mm -- leaving +/- .35
		The CY's probably extend 0.8 mm beyond the end of the cap, or .5mm beyond the edge of the pin
		The pads are about 2.2mm apart on the inside

	So that makes us go with 1.5 mm width and 3 mm length, spaced 2.6mm apart

	The CY's USB power traces are 'only' 30 mils	

	RECHECKED 7/7/7 -- these seem like good assumptions	

Decoupling cap size:
	EIA size code 603 = Metric code 1608
	Our part is C1608X7R1C104KT -- there's the 1608 

-> USE SMN7351 library ('Nominal' library) -- the SMM 'Most' or SML 'Least' libraries give bad info

EZ-HOST layout:
	The user guide references JEDEC MS-026 compliance but does not list the exact model (probably BED)
	First attempt:  .30mm x 1.6mm, 15.4mm center
	PCB libraries recommends 15.4mm center with .30mm x 1.5mm pads -- I'm close enough

	I copied my 1.6mm pad from the CY4640 ref design, so it should work!
	The key is that the center points match... that .05mm on either side of the pad is harmless

	Assembly guide:  14x14 = (Center 6x6) = -1-13, -1-13

VQ64 layout:
	The package document says this is JEDEC MS-026ACD
	First attempt:	.30mm x 1.6mm, -2.75 thru 10.25 = 13mm edge, 11.4mm center to center, 9.8mm inside 
	PCB libraries recommends 11.4mm center to center with .30mm x 1.5mm pads -- I was very close!
	I have no clue how I got this right (even on the first time), but I'm leaving it...

	Assembly guide:  10x10 = (Center 3.75x3.75) = -1.25-8.75x-1.25x8.75

TSOP48 layout:
	The user guide says this is JEDEC MO-142DD -- which is listed in PCB Libraries
	First attempt:  .30mm x 1.6mm, 21mm edge, 19.4mm center to center, 17.8 inside
	PCB libraries (maximal) recommends 19.9mm center to center with .30mm x 1.45mm pads -- that's 21.35mm edge
	That's a huge fuck up on my part...  Now fixed, after much struggling
	Awesome -- that was two fuck-ups in a row -- I used the maximal layout by accident -- too late now

	Assembly guide:  18.5x12.1 = 0.65-19.15 X -.3-11.8

MSOP8 layout:
	The user guide says this is JEDEC MO-187 -- probably AA-T
	MINIMAL PCB libraries recommends .45 x 1.15 pads, 4.2 pad space, .65 pitch -- AGH!
	Nominal PCB libraries recommends .45 x 1.4 pads, 4.4 pad space

	I'm shrinking the PowerPad to 1.85x1.85 to simplify solder masking (.975x2.2 center)
	My thermals will suck but less so than the alternative...

	Assembly guide:  3.0x3.0 = (Center: .975 x 2.2) = -0.525-2.475 x -.7-3.7

Crystal dimensions:
	Pads are 2.0x5.5 with 9.5 RECOMMENDED center spacing
	I actually used 8.5 center spacing when aping CY4640 -- fixed now
	Assembly guide:  4.8x11.4 = (Center: 0 x 4.75) = -2.4-2.4x-0.95-10.45

Jag cart edge pins:
   Width:
	0.059 inch typical spacing (3.186 total, or 3.127 for 53)
	0.287 center start, 3.414 center end (aka 3.127 for 53 again)
	0.237 board start, 3.465 edge end
   Recalculated start (from behind):
	0 board start, 3.228 end (EXACTLY 82mm)
	0.050 center of first pin, 3.177 center of last pin (-0.051 from edge)
	Notch at .787 (2.441) is 0.383 high and 0.067 wide
		Start at .821 (2.407), end at .753 (2.475)
		The bit ends at 0.383 - 0.034 = 0.349
   Height:
	0.047 power fingers start (.303 high), 0.110 signals start (.240 high)
	0.350 signals end

Jag cart edge connector:
	Widens at 0.350 (widen to 3.702)
	Notch at 2.678 is 0.383 high and 0.067 wide

USB A pinout (87520):
	Holes are .92mm according to datasheet, .91mm by the CY4640 drill file
	Pads are 1.5mm (according to CY4640 design)
	That gives us .29mm pad radius -- is that legal?

	Mounting holes are 2.3mm (by datasheet and CY4640)
		On CY4640, mounting holes are attached to a copper fill that bridges all devices
		The schematic calls this 'shield ground' and it is _not_ attached to real ground
		They have optional (no load) resistors to let you do this if you wanna... we don't wanna
		The pads are 3.3mm (.5mm pad radius)

	All 6 pins are plated!

	Poly line:
		With no backshield, we extend 3.75 mm past the mounting hole
			This is 1.04mm behind the center of the pins
		We extend 10.3mm beyond past the mounting hole
			This is 13mm beyond the center of the pins
		We extend 13.1 to either side -- i.e., 6.6 (with no back shield)
		The front extends 7 to either side

USB B pinout (61729):
	Same as A for the most part
	10.3 mm 'tall' past the origin, 5.7mm before the origin
	6.1 mm wide to either side (12.2 total)

USB mini-B pinout:
	The CY4640 has two little holes drilled beneath it, maybe for ease of removal?
		I noticed that they did the same thing on the TQ100.

	The traces are 0.8 apart and 0.5 wide
	The outline is 9mm 'high', from .75 to -0.825
	The outline is 10mm 'wide', from -5 to 5

Pinouts for XC9572:

	Power:	(Int) 3, 37 (IO) 26, 55
	GND:	14, 21, 41, 54

	JTAG:	TCK=30, TDI=28, TDO=53, TMS=29

	Everything else is IO (64-12=52)
