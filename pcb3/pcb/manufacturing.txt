My board is at 8 mil copper/8 mil space tolerance...
MUST USE 1 oz copper!

A typical pick and place machine does 400x175 or 300x225 mm panels
	Our boards are about 82mm wide and 36mm tall
	A stretch goal is 3x6 panelization (37.5mm tall -- very difficult with cut/scoring limits)
	An alternative is 2x10 panelization allowing 87.5mm x 40mm -- maybe just achievable
	Scoring rules want 4mm 'hands off' from the edge of the board...
		So that probably makes 90mmx42mm...
	Most machines need 0.5" rail clearance -- is that vertical or does it chew into the sides of the board?

Prototyping costs:
	Cheapest solution:
		protoexpress for boards ($48 each for 4 layer at qty 3 = $150 -- ridiculously cheap)
			Pick them up locally after 4 business days
		aapcb for assembly ($480 for 3 based on normal quote, or $245 for 3 using crazy discount)
	Fastest solution:
		Advanced Circuits is a one stop shop with similar prices to Screaming Circuits
		PCBExpress + Screaming Circuits has cheaper PCB fabrication and competitive turn times
		Either solution wants $600+
		PCBExpress offers 3 day turn on 2 4-layer HASL OR SILVER IMMERSION for $140 
		Screaming Circuits in turn wants $520 for 2 in 2 days (due to high BOM count) add $31/board
	Silver immersion is probably all we need for fine pitch components and our edge connector
		For silver immersion, they recommend via pads be left 'open' (uncovered by solder mask)


	Screamingcircuits wants $380 for the first board, $15 each thereafter... That's without PCB manufacture
	PcbFabExpress won't even go to such low quantities
		At 5, they want ~$650
	hotcpb.com won't give a quote but they have prototype assembly in Santa Clara
	http://www.aapcb.com/ "Does it Smoke?" -- $245 for 3 boards... No PCB manufacture
		They need an XYRS file for automated placement...  They are in Aurora, Colorado
	http://www.norcommcorp.com/ will quote you -- in Grass Valley near Auburn, CA
		See Google Groups message on them
	http://www.risingtechnologies.net/ said to be cheap -- in Wisconsin

	If I pay ~$250 for 3 boards I did good
	I just need to finish my files to start shopping it around

	Silvtronics is cheapest, but they are not gonna touch less than 100 units because of fine-pitch

0.2mm routing in FreePCB is about 8mil/8mil... probably enough?
	The next setting down is 4mil/4mil, so...  :P

The CY4640 has 6 mil/0.15mm traces -- it looks like it was routed in mils with lots of off-center traces
	The pads are .307 mm wide with .194 mm spacing -- i.e., 12 mils with 7.6 mil gap
	We can manage .3/.2mm just fine
	The pads are 1.6mm high
	The starts of the pads are ~13.772 apart
	The ends of the pads are ~17.029 apart

-> I have 8 mil traces and 14 mil vias...  The CY4640 seems to have 10 mil vias
	
The ECS CSM-7-DN shows a 15 mm wide pad, but CY4640 used 14 mm with no ill effects

Design for manufacture rules:
	http://www.4pcb.com/index.php?load=content&page_id=93

	"Leave 100 mills between components and PCB edge"
		Hopefully this does not apply to USB parts...

I'm using 14 mil vias, but most people want 15-18 mil vias...
	I'm also as low as 7.6 mil clearances in places when 8 mil is the (cheaper) norm

Possibilities:
	Pcbfabexpress is about $9.33/part @ 180 and they allow panelizing...  Located in Sunnyvale, pretty nice!
		$9.33 covers assembly only -- 1330.35 + 350 NRE for 10 panels/10 days
		PCB 'deals' don't allow panelizing... not clear what would!
		6mil/6mil
	eTekNet is $11/part @ 180 -- PCB and assembly included!
		$433 NRE, $1460 manufacturing, $74 shipping -- so, only $8.50 for the 'second run'
		Said to be 'half the cost' of Pcbfabexpress
		They are a broker for an Asian manufacturer -- but ship from crates in Mesa, Arizona
		Can do 5mil/5mil, but this quote was on 8mil/8mil -- looks like no big difference
	MyroPCB is as little as $6/part, but it's Chinese labor...
		6mil/6mil specs
		and the turnaround time is pretty long...
		Looks like AtariAge guys have used them
	Screaming circuits is $16/part @ 180 just for assembly :-(
		PCBExpress uses Screaming Circuits...
		-> I DID THE QUOTE WRONG TOO -- they want to quote by board, not full panels
	Silvtronics is around $10/board @ 432 (but that includes PCB manufacture and shipping)
		8mil/12mil
		-> Silvtronics design rules probably do not allow manufacture of this board...
	futurlec?
		Can do it, but only 2 layer...forget it!
	protoexpress.com?  (said to be cheap for 4 layers...)
		They say call for quote
		They're in the bay area too
	pcbnet.com?
		Quotes are _very_ cheap -- might be competitive with eTekNet -- no good for proto

	FlexOne -- In San Jose, has right capabilities, no hint on pricing

	Advanced Circuits (4pcb) is the premiere one -- everybody talks about how good it is -- pricey?
		Who cares, they don't do assembly!  Actually they do -- slightly cheaper than Screaming Circuits

GerbMerge is a good tool for panelization

Silvtronics numbers:
	PCB:		24 panels @ 18 @ 4L = 408 + 14 * 34 + 50 + 24 * 16 = $1318/432
	Assembly:	200 setup + 30*432*0.8 part + 432..1296/fine pitch = $2532/432
	shipping:	$1/unit (both ways) = $432/432

	$3.05/PCB + $5.86/assemble + $1/shipping = $10/board @ 432!
