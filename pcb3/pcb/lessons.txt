PUT IN POWER PORTS
	Put headers for _anything_ you plan to do during bring-up (external power, clock measurement, etc)
	I have no idea how I'm going to test power input...

Trace geometry is no big deal -- 8mil/8mil is very safe no matter how you do it
Hole geometry is a _huge_ deal -- check clearances against ACTUAL hole sizes  :-(
	Be very conservative with vias and pads -- add extra clearance if you can

Get your footprints exactly right, with courtyards, before you get very far.
	Learned again on capacitors and very painfully on crystals...

Route the important signals (clocks, USB, etc) FIRST -- do not wait until the end.
Route multipoint signals next, including power and reset.

Then it's time to play...

Don't bother routing traces end-to-end as you 'explore' a design space
	Just getting them roughly where they go -- overlapping vias and all, is fine
		You can easily select and move them this way without wasting time
	Pen and paper is the most productive way -- just draw out _every_ signal
	Watch out for the ones that cross/block -- and then pay special attention

Spend lots of time getting the schematic right -- and maintain it in PADS form
	FreePCB will happily flag duplicate assignments and ratlines really help

Explore minor part alterations -- missing out on the 322 was really bad
	Part placement would be tighter with a 322, with faster programming, less caps

Maintain your BOM with Digikey part numbers all the way from the early what-if stages
	This makes it easy to get quotes at any point
Also, it makes it obvious when your BOM is getting too big...
	Unique components are the biggest cost in prototype assembly... keep BOM short!

Drop ship direct from Digikey to assembler -- lots less work and no double-checking
	And Digikey is fast -- they ship faster than the PCB house
